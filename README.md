# e_commerce

We will develop a full-featured e-commerce mobile application using Flutter and Provider for state management. The app will offer a seamless shopping experience, starting with a home screen that displays all product categories, with all items shown by default. Users can filter products by selecting specific categories, and upon clicking on an item, they will be directed to a detailed view that includes high-quality images, available colors, prices, and product descriptions. Shoppers can add items to their cart or mark them as favorites for later. The cart section will track the total cost of selected items and provide options for item removal. Similarly, the favorites section will allow users to manage their liked items with ease.
